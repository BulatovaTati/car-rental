# RentalCar Frontend

## Project Description

RentalCar is the frontend part of a web application for a car rental company. The app allows users to browse a catalog of cars, filter them by different criteria, view detailed information about each
car, and book a rental.

## Main Features

-   Home page with a banner and call-to-action button
-   Catalog page displaying cars with filtering options (brand, price, mileage)
-   Ability to add cars to favorites, saved even after page reload
-   Detailed car page with booking form
-   Pagination with a "Load More" button to fetch more cars

## Technologies Used

-   React with Vite bundler
-   Redux for state management
-   React Router for routing
-   Axios for API requests

## Pages and Routes

-   `/` — Home page
-   `/catalog` — Car catalog with filters and favorites
-   `/catalog/:id` — Detailed car page

```

## Backend Integration

Uses the backend API documented here: [https://car-rental-api.goit.global/api-docs/](https://car-rental-api.goit.global/api-docs/) All filtering and pagination happen via backend requests.
